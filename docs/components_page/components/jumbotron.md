## Examples

The Jumbotron component was removed in Bootstrap 5, so there is no longer a dedicated `Jumbotron` component in _dash-bootstrap-components_ either. However, thanks to Bootstrap's flexible utility classes, it is easy to recreate a jumbotron-like layout yourself. Here's a simple example

{{example:components/jumbotron/simple.py:jumbotron}}

### Styling the "Jumbotron"

There are [many utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/) available in Bootstrap. By combining them you can easily customise the look and feel of your app.
